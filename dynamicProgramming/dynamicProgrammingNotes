dynamic programming = divide & conquer + memoization
use recursion and hashing/memoization to improve efficiency of functions

questions to ask if a problem can use dynamic programming

1. can it be divided into subproblem (can each problem be divided into smaller problems -> smaller problems -> smaller problems)
2. can the the solution be recusive
3. are there repetitive subproblems
4. memoize subproblems
